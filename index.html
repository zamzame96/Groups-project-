        <ul>
            <li>Light: Bright, indirect sunlight.</li>
            <li>Water: Water when the top inch of soil is dry.</li>
            <li>Temperature: Prefers temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C).</li>
            <li>Humidity: Enjoys high humidity but can adapt to average indoor humidity.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>I'm a compact plant and a relatively slow grower but I could reach as high as 1m.</li>
            <li>I like medium to moderate light. If my leaves are dark, they can handle more light, if they're light, I'll only be able to tolerate medium light.</li>
            <li>Keep my soil lightly moist constantly but be careful not to overwater me as my delicate roots are susceptible to rot.</li>
            <li>Keep me away from draughts and in temperatures of between 18 and 24°C.</li>
            <li>Please feed me diluted fertiliser once a month during the growing season.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Light: Aloe plants need bright, indirect sunlight. They can tolerate some direct sunlight, especially in the morning, but too much direct sun can cause the leaves to turn brown.</li>
                <li>Water: Water deeply but infrequently. Allow the top inch or two of soil to dry out completely between waterings. Overwatering can lead to root rot.</li>
                <li>Temperature: Aloe plants prefer temperatures between 55-80°F (13-27°C). They can tolerate cooler temperatures but should be protected from frost.</li>
                <li>Humidity: Aloe plants do well in low humidity. They are adapted to arid conditions and do not require additional humidity.</li>
                <li>Soil: Use a well-draining soil mix, such as a cactus or succulent mix. Adding perlite or sand to regular potting soil can improve drainage.</li>

            <h11>care Tips</h11>
            <ul>
                <li>Light: Orchids prefer bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch the leaves, so place them in a location where they receive filtered light or morning sun.</li>
                <li>Water: Water orchids once a week, allowing the potting medium to dry out slightly between waterings. Avoid letting the plant sit in water, as this can lead to root rot.</li>
                <li>Temperature: Orchids thrive in temperatures between 60-75°F (16-24°C) during the day and slightly cooler at night. Avoid exposing them to cold drafts or sudden temperature changes.</li>
                <li>Humidity: Orchids prefer high humidity levels, ideally between 50-70%. Increase humidity by placing a tray of water with pebbles under the pot or using a humidifier.</li>
                <li>Soil: Use a well-draining orchid mix, typically made of bark, perlite, and sphagnum moss. Avoid using regular potting soil as it retains too much moisture.</li>
